abstract: "We present INCA (short for INfrastructure for
Content Analysis), a Python module for collecting, storing,
processing, and analyzing a wide variety of media content,
including but not limited to news, political debates, social media,
forums, and customer reviews. Using Elasticsearch as a database
backend and Celery for task management, it makes automated
content analysis scalable. INCAâ€™s main objective is to enable and
promote an integrated workflow. INCA focuses on re-usability of
data, processors, and analyses; making all steps of automated
content analysis (ACA) accessible to social scientists, without
requiring advanced programming skills. Here, we present the
aim, implementation, and recommended workflow for INCA."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary: This study investigates reasons and motivations which might lead people to prefer algorithmic gatekeepers over human ones.
