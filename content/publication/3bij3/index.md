abstract: "Today’s online news environment is increasingly characterized by personali-zed news selections, relying on algorithmic solutions for extracting relevant articles and composing an individual’s news diet. Yet, the impact of such re-commendation  algorithms  on  how  we  consume  and  perceive  news  is  still  understudied. We therefore developed one of the first software solutions to conduct  studies  on  effects  of  news  recommender  systems  in  a  realistic  set-ting. The web app of our framework (called 3bij3) displays real-time news ar-ticles selected by different mechanisms. 3bij3 can be used to conduct large-scale field experiments, in which participants’ use of the site can be tracked over  extended  periods  of  time.  Compared  to  previous  work,  3bij3  gives  re-searchers control over the recommendation system under study and creates a realistic environment for the participants. It integrates web scraping, diffe-rent methods to compare and classify news articles, different recommender systems, a web interface for participants, gamification elements, and a user survey to enrich the behavioural measures obtained."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary: This study investigates reasons and motivations which might lead people to prefer algorithmic gatekeepers over human ones.
