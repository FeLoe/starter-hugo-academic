Welcome to my website! I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Center of Social Media and Politics (CSMaP)](https://csmapnyu.org) at the NYU where I am working on projects around social media and politics. Prior to this, I have been a PhD student in Political Communication Science at the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/felicia-loecherbach). My dissertation was part of the NWO-funded project ["Inside the filter bubble"](http://ccs.amsterdam/projects/jeds-tracking-the-filter-bubble/). Before joining the Department at the Vrije Universiteit, I received a research master degree from the [Amsterdam School of Communication Research](https://ascor.uva.nl).

My research interests include (the diversity of) online news consumption and using computational methods in the social sciences. I am motivated by the impact that changes in online environments have on the understanding and usage of news. Specifically, I use computational approaches to study when and where users come across different types of news -- collecting digital trace data via innovative approaches such as [data donations](https://github.com/uvacw/osd2f), analyzing different dimensions of diversity of the content and how it affects perceptions and attitudes of users. Apart from this, I have been involved in studying the challenges of different modes of news access, for example via news recommender systems and smart assistants.

I am part of the [Computational Social Science Amsterdam](http://ccs.amsterdam) group. Ouside of my own research, I am the early career representative of the [Computational Methods Division](https://www.icahdq.org/group/compmethds) of the International Communication Association and on the editorial board of the open access journal [Computational Communication Research](https://computationalcommunication.org/ccr). I frequently teach computational methods (R and Python) to social scientists.
